# New Feature
- Slack notifications can now include attachments. The README file explains the interaction between text, text_file and attachments properties.  
See the [Slack documentation on message +attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments) for the message structure  

Thank you to [tshak](https://github.com/tshak) for adding this feature!
